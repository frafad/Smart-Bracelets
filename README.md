# Smart Bracelets
Project for the course Internet of Things at PoliMi.

## Introduction

We are requested to implement and test a software prototype for a smart bracelet. The bracelet is worn by a child and his/her
parent to keep track of the child’s position and trigger alerts when a child goes
too far or falls. To test our implementation, we simulate the functioning
of two couples of bracelets simultaneously.

## Approach

For our solution we used the suite of tools presented during the course’s laboratory classes. In particular, we chose **TinyOS** (v. 2.1.2) to write the bracelet’s
code and **TOSSIM** to simulate our TinyOS applications. We developed the
project using the course laboratory’s virtual machine, where these tools were
already available.
